# JavaEE8-Playground
Test project for playing with Java EE 8 APIs. Includes support for all Java EE 8 specifications, utilizing the official Java EE 8 maven coordinates.

This project has been tested and verified to work on Payara-5 branch.  

I will update the project occasionally to add new demos.  Stay tuned.  Please send feedback to my twitter handle at @javajuneau.

Thanks
